# lychee-docker
This image contains a working Lychee installation which uses the ubuntu:18.04 or the nginx:1.13.12-alpine base-image.
We also provide some example docker-compose.yml files, to help connecting the container to a MariaDB database.

# Disclaimer
The image that is uploaded to the Docker Hub uses the nginx:alpine base. If you want to use the ubuntu one, you will have to clone the repo and build it yourself.
