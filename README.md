# lychee-docker
This image contains a working Lychee installation which uses the ubuntu:18.04 or the nginx:1.13.12-alpine base-image.
We've also provided some example docker-compose.yml files, to help connecting the container with a MariaDB database.

# Disclaimer
The image is not yet available on the Docker Hub, we will update the Docker-Compose file as soon as that is the case.
